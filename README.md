# Web Application Development

## Summary
The "Hoosier Connection" was my senior capstone project at Indiana University, utilizing the SCRUM framework to build a website connecting people through shared interests and live experiences. Developed with php, mysql, javascript, css, html, and rivet, it integrated Google Sign-In and an open-source Calendar API. Over the course of 10 months I strengthened technical knowledge, interpersonal abilities, and teamwork skills.

## Project Overview 
### Identify:
- Identified a common problem, _lack of human connection in our local community (Bloomington)_
- Identified target audience, project scope, expected outcome, and stakeholders
### Plan:
- Defined key individual responsibilities, developed wireframes, and project timeline
### Build:
- Weeks of coding, testing, and iterating, to develop core features necessary for the website.
- Integrate outside functions and APIs _(i.e. Google Login)_
### Test:
- User testings and usability testing to restructure and re-tune the features, layout, and flow of our site
- Finalizing website features and revisiting code
